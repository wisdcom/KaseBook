# Basic Relationship

To track companies and their products:

* [x] Make two Decks: **Companies**, and **Product Lines**.
* [x] In Product Lines, add a Link field called "**make**" and select Companies as the **link to deck**.

That's it.

{% tab title="\"Companies\" deck" %}

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="\"Product Lines\" deck" %}
![](../../.gitbook/assets/simulator-screen-shot-iphone-11-pro-2019-11-12-at-21.15.09.png)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="\"make\" field" %}

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Now that a relation is defined, any Card in Product Lines can link to a Companies card, establishing a two-way relationship:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="" %}
![](../../.gitbook/assets/simulator-screen-shot-iphone-11-pro-2019-11-12-at-21.35.38.png)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="" %}
![](../../.gitbook/assets/simulator-screen-shot-iphone-11-pro-2019-11-12-at-21.17.50.png)
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

From the other direction, any Companies card can easily browse to all Product Lines that belong to the company:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="" %}
![](../../.gitbook/assets/simulator-screen-shot-iphone-11-pro-2019-11-12-at-21.20.39.png)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="" %}
![](../../.gitbook/assets/simulator-screen-shot-iphone-11-pro-2019-11-12-at-21.26.00%20%281%29.png)
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
