# Deck of Cards

## Views & Filters

A Deck can define any number of Views and Filters. A View defines how the Deck is displayed, including Listing options \(e.g. grouping, sort orders\) and Content options \(e.g. icon size, whether tags is shown\). A View also can choose one of the Deck's defined Filters as the designated Filter.

A Filter defines which Cards are included in a View. As of Kase 2.2, Filters are currently limited to one criterion: whether the Card has a Picture or not.

### View Options

#### Listing Options

* **Group by Categories**
  * This option groups the Cards by Category. You can think of it as "Sort by Category" first, like a level 0 sort option in addition to the three levels of sort options below.
  * Categories will be in the order they are arranged. To change the order:
    * Go into any Card and then tap on the **Category** row \(the Card Category icon is the one with four small squares in different shades\).
    * Turn on Edit mode by tapping on the **Edit** button on the bottom right.
    * Manually adjust the order by dragging on the **arrange bar** on the right, or sort them by names using the **Sort** button on bottom left.
    * Finish by tapping on the **Edit** button again.
* **Group Summary**
* **Sort by \[Field\] \[Ascending/Descending\]**
  * Each View can define up to three levels of sorting.
  * Each sorting level can sort on any one of these fields in ascending or descending order:
    * Name
    * Notes
    * Date Modified
    * Date Created
    * Links Count
    * or User-defined Custom Fields

#### Content Options

* **Icon**
* **Show Tags**
